  I just started this project idea to make a ball bounce animation. I just set up the background to have a sky and ground with a linear gradient so it looks pretty cool.

  I just made this ball bounce up and down with a cool shadow effect and everything! I cant believe I learned how to do this today!! This is so cool hahaha. When I come back to this I want to make it so i dont have to hover directly on the ball to make it bounce because it bounces out of the mouse if it goes up too far which stops the animation.
